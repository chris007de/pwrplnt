=======

pwrplnt is an Arduino powered system for automatic gardening.
It uses several sensors and actuators to enable a standalone operation of your herb garden.

Hardware needed:
- Arduino (Mega if Ethernet support is desired)
- Water pump
- LED stripe (grow light, red and blue LEDs)
- Water reservoir

Minimum sensors/actuators needed for gardening operation:
- Moisture sensor (analog, e.g. ...)
- Relais for water pump
- PWM driver or relais for LED stripe

Optional supported sensors:
- Temperature/Humidity sensor (DHT11, digital 1-Wire interface)
- Brightness sensor (analog)
- Fill level sensor (for low water level Alarm)
- RTC module for more exact timing
- Ethernet/Wifi Shield for observation and plotting of data
